Kddrescueview
=============

Description
-----------

Kddrescueview is a graphical viewer for [GNU ddrescue](https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/)
mapfiles. It shows damaged and recovered disk areas on a colored grid. 
Kddrescueview provides a KPart for integration in other KDE applications.

Although written from scratch in C++/Qt (more exactly from the KPart template),
Kddrescueview draws heavily on Martin Bittermann's excellent 
[ddrescueview](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ddrescueview/). You can 
definitively call it plagiarism. Unless you need the KDE integration, you probably 
want to use ddrescueview which offers much more features.

This program is free software released under the GNU GPL version 2 or (at your 
option) version 3 or any later version accepted by the membership of KDE e.V.
